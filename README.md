# WebGames
The purpose of this code is that it allows game developers to host mulitple game through my website.
All you have to do is to download my file and to input it game code into the shown areas.
Have fun!
## prerequisite

- [javascript]
- [p5]

## How to put your game on my website:
1. Put the draw functions of your game in the corresponding modes in sketch.js. For example, if you wanted to connect your game to button two, then you would put the animated parts of your game into the if statement for mode 2 in sketch.js.
2. All variables set must be global. Put it on the top of sketch.js.
3. Now the bulk of your code, such as the Object Oreinted Design, should go into a seperate file, connected to the game through index.html, on a script. (e.g. <script type="text/javascript" src="snake.js"></script>)
